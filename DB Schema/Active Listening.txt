• Example:
– Sender: I am finding it increasingly difficult to survive in this
company. There is no support, no appreciation…it’s just too

enough. I have never seen people with real potential talk like
this!
• Judge:

• Example:

are wondering what to do about it?

Practice (1)
• Sometimes I get so depressed I can hardly
stand it. Here I am, 25 years old, and still not
having a decent job! It’s not that I haven’t had
any chances, but I never really liked any
opportunity that came my way. All my friends
are working, earning well, and I can’t
understand why I can’t! Is there something
wrong with me?

Practice (2)
• I am really concerned about my friend Amol.
He never seems to take life seriously enough.
He left college midway, got a job with a
startup and then quit within weeks. He has
started drinking and now wants to go see the
country! I am really worried that he’ll end up
ruining his life. I don’t know what I could do?

Epilogue

tendency gets stronger when emotions run
high.
