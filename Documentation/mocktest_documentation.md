# üìò InsightPrep - Mock Test System Documentation

## üéØ Project Overview
**InsightPrep** is a comprehensive, client-side, browser-based mock test system that runs entirely on HTML + JavaScript. The tagline "Where Preparation Meets Reflection" emphasizes both learning and self-assessment.

The system supports dual data sources (JSON files and SQLite databases) and provides advanced filtering capabilities for targeted practice with complete offline functionality.

## ‚úÖ Major Accomplishments

### 1. Dual Data Source Support
- **JSON Mode**: Loads questions from custom JSON files
- **Database Mode**: Loads questions from SQLite database files
- Seamless switching between data sources
- Automatic detection and handling of different data formats

### 2. Hierarchical Topic Organization
- **Two-level hierarchy**: Topic ‚Üí Subtopic structure
- **Smart filtering**: Users can select specific topic/subtopic combinations
- **Automatic fallback**: Questions without subtopics default to "General"
- **Visual organization**: Hierarchical checkbox interface with indeterminate states

### 3. Advanced Question Engine
- **Multiple question types**:
  - Single correct MCQs
  - Multiple correct MCQs  
  - Assertion‚ÄìReason questions
  - Match-the-Following (dropdown-based)
  - True/False questions
- **Smart randomization**: Both question order and option order shuffled
- **Immediate feedback**: Real-time answer validation and explanations

### 4. Sophisticated Filtering System
- **Topic/Subtopic Selection**: Hierarchical checkbox system with "Select All" functionality
- **Question Type Filtering**: Choose specific question types or all
- **Dynamic Question Counting**: Real-time updates of available questions based on filters
- **Smart Validation**: Prevents invalid selections and shows helpful messages

### 5. Enhanced User Experience
- **Context-Aware Navigation**: Different button sets for different app states
  - Start Page: Only "Choose JSON" and "Choose DB"
  - Options Page: File selection + "Back to Start Page" 
  - Test Page: Test-specific controls (no file selection buttons)
- **Professional UI**: Card-based layout with smooth transitions
- **Comprehensive How-to-Use Guide**: Detailed interactive guide on start page
- **Performance Feedback**: Tailored messages based on test results

### 6. JSON Mode Improvements
- **Simplified Interface**: Removed complex balanced mode (JSON always uses random selection)
- **Hierarchical Support**: Full support for topic/subtopic structure
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic max question count updates when filters change
- **Consistent Experience**: Matching interface with database mode

### 7. Database Mode Features
- **SQLite Integration**: Full support for SQLite database files
- **Balanced Selection**: Advanced algorithms for balanced question distribution
- **Question Counting**: Shows question counts per topic/subtopic
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of database schema variations

### 8. Navigation & State Management
- **Clean State Transitions**: Proper button visibility management across app states
- **Memory Management**: Efficient event listener cleanup and DOM management
- **Workflow Reset**: Complete state reset when returning to start page  
  - `reference` (optional).  

### 6. Test Banks Prepared
- A **50-question JSON** with mixed topics and types.  
- A **balanced 50-question JSON** with equal distribution of question types.  

### 7. Workflow & Reset
- **Choose Test** clears all existing state and starts fresh with a new JSON file.  
- Old questions and results are cleared properly.  

### 8. Header-Level Restart
- Added a **Restart Test** button next to **Choose Test**.  
- Restarts the same test immediately using the **previously selected filters**.  
- Keeps bottom ‚ÄúRestart Test‚Äù (after results) as an additional option.

### 9. Data Format & Schema
- **Enhanced JSON Schema**: 
  - `topic` and `subtopic` fields for hierarchical organization
  - `type`, `question`, `options`, `answer` or `matchPairs`
  - `explanation` and `reference` (optional)
  - Full backward compatibility with existing JSON files
- **Database Schema Support**: 
  - SQLite tables with flexible schema detection
  - Automatic fallback for missing subtopic columns
  - Support for various question types and options tables

### 10. Test Management Features
- **Multiple Restart Options**:
  - Restart same test with same questions
  - Generate new questions with same filters  
  - Return to options to modify filters
- **Session Continuity**: Maintains filter preferences during test sessions
- **Error Prevention**: Smart validation prevents invalid test configurations

### 11. Security & Performance
- **Client-Side Only**: No server dependencies, fully offline capable
- **Memory Efficient**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and DOM elements
- **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization and safe DOM manipulation
- **Secure Database Operations**: Parameter binding for SQL queries
